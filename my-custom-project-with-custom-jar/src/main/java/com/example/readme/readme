===================================== How to create own Maven Dependencies and use them in your project ================================

 I am assuming that ther are two project i.e. One is Source and another is Target .

#1:) first use :: mvn clean install :: in the source project .
#2:) then copy the ::             <groupId>com.madeeasy</groupId>
                                  <artifactId>addition-of-two-numbers</artifactId>
                                  <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
#3:) this groupId and artifactId and version will be used in the targated project as a dependency like this ::
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.madeeasy</groupId>
            <artifactId>addition-of-two-numbers</artifactId>
            <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
        </dependency>
